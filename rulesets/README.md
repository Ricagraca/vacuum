## OWASP Rules

The table provides an overview of OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) rules, which are security guidelines and best practices for building secure web applications. Each rule focuses on a specific aspect of API security and suggests measures to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.


| Rule                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Severity     | Implemented |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| OwaspAPIRuleNoNumericIDs            | Use random IDs that cannot be guessed. UUIDs are preferred                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Error        |      X       |
| OWASPRuleSecuritySchemeUseHTTPBasic | Security scheme uses HTTP Basic. Use a more secure authentication method, like OAuth 2.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Error        |      X       |
| OWASPRuleNoAPIKeysInURL             | API Keys are (usually opaque) strings that are passed in headers, cookies, or query parameters to access APIs. Those keys can be eavesdropped, especially when they are stored in cookies or passed as URL parameters.                                                                                                                  | Error        |      X       |
| OWASPRuleSecurityCredentialsDetected| URL parameters MUST NOT contain credentials such as API key, password, or secret. See RAC_GEN_004                                                                                                                                | Error        |     X        |
| OWASPRuleAuthInsecureSchemes        | There are many HTTP authorization schemes, but some of them are now considered insecure, such as negotiating authentication using specifications like NTLM or OAuth v1                                                                                                               | Error        |       X      |
| OWASPRuleJWTBestPractices           | Security schemes using JWTs must explicitly declare support for RFC8725 in the description                                                                                                                                                     There                                                                                                | Error        |      X       |
| OWASPRuleProtectionGlobalUnsafe     |                                                                                                                                                                                              | Warn         |      TODO       |
| OWASPRuleProtectionGlobalUnsafeStrict|  | Warn         |      TODO       |
| OWASPRuleProtectionGlobalSafe       |  | Warn         |       TODO     |
| OWASPRuleDefineErrorValidation      |      Carefully define schemas for all the API responses, including either 400, 422, or 4XX responses which describe errors caused by invalid requests                                                                                                                                                            | Warn         |     uses a function     |
| OWASPRuleDefineErrorResponses401    |  OWASP API Security recommends defining schemas for all responses, even errors. The 401 describes what happens when a request is unauthorized, so its important to define this not just for documentation, but to empower contract testing to make sure the proper JSON structure is being returned instead of leaking implementation details in backtraces                                                                                                                                                                 | Warn         |      X      |
| OWASPRuleDefineErrorResponses500    |  OWASP API Security recommends defining schemas for all responses, even errors. The 500 describes what happens when a request fails with an internal server error, so its important to define this not just for documentation, but to empower contract testing to make sure the proper JSON structure is being returned instead of leaking implementation details in backtraces                                                                                                                                                                 | Warn         |      X      |
| OWASPRuleRateLimit                  |  Define proper rate limiting to avoid attackers overloading the API. There are many ways to implement rate-limiting, but most of them involve using HTTP headers, and there are two popular ways to do that:\n\nIETF Draft HTTP RateLimit Headers:. https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers/\n\nCustomer headers like X-Rate-Limit-Limit (Twitter: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) or X-RateLimit-Limit (GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api)                                                                                                                                                                 | Warn         |       uses a function     |

| OWASPRuleRateLimitRetryAfter                  |  Define proper rate limiting to avoid attackers overloading the API. Part of that involves setting a Retry-After header so well meaning consumers are not polling and potentially exacerbating problems                                                                                                                                                               | Error         |       X     |
